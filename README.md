# Result Management System – Java Swing + File Handling

The Result Management System is a desktop-based Java application designed to efficiently manage student academic records. Built using Java Swing, the system provides a modern graphical user interface for entering, calculating, and storing student result data with persistent file storage.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of GUI development, event-driven programming, and file handling for data persistence.
